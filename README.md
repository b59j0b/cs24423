Assessment 2 – Title Sequence 
Due: Week   11 –   Friday 4:00 pm
Project Overview 
For this assessment, you will develop a series of skills that introduce you to   the fundamental   principles   of   multimedia.   During the process of this assessment, you are required to   document your   creative   process from   pre-production   to post-production explaining the technical, visual, audio and text choices made   in the   production   of your digital   animated   project.
You are required to produce a 20-30 second   animated title   sequence for   a feature film   using Adobe After   Effects. Your   title sequence will include graphic, typographic and audio elements. You will   use Adobe   Illustrator/Photoshop to create   the graphic components and Adobe Audition to prepare the audio. You will document all   your   progress work   in   the form. of a digital development   book.
Your teacher will provide a list of films to choose from.
Knowledge and Skills 
At the completion of this assessment, you should be able   to:
-                Investigate themes and examples of multimedia   and   kinetic typography   projects
-                Construct   justified opinions of analytical tasks
-                Understand how consideration for degrees of abstraction   and simplicity   apply   to   the   design   process
-                Document and annotate creative methods for the   development   of   kinetic   typographic   outcomes
-                Apply principles and elements of   multimedia
-                Apply principles of typography
-                Explore software tools for the creation of animation
-                Apply reflective practice towards the use of stylistic features   and visual   language   in   the   creation   of a   kinetic   typography product.
-                Use appropriate design terminology to explain and   justify your   ideas
Research 
Examine 3 title sequences with a focus on different styles and techniques.   Write a description for each including the following:
• analysis   of   the   concept
• analysis   of   the   visual   style.	
• analysis   of   the   sound
Use the research phase to consider and reflect on the type of sequence you want to develop. 
Make sure to also include technical research   in your development   book   (software tutorials   etc.).
Concept Development 
•    Brainstorm words, themes and ideas related to the film you choose.
•    Develop 2 concepts that explore the main themes of your chosen film. 
• Choose the best concept and develop a comprehensive storyboard   with   a focus   on   camera   angles      movements.
•    Draw the graphic components for your title sequence.
•    Draw the background for your title sequence.
Design Refinement 
•    Produce your graphic components and backgrounds in Adobe   Illustrator/Photoshop.
•    Explore at least 3 different font options for your title sequence. 
•    Explore the mise en scène; the overall look   and feel   of your sequence.
• Consider   the   colour    lighting   of   your   sequence   (in   reference   to   your   chosen   film).
•   Consider design principles when creating various moving sequences.
•    Explore different sound effects for the animated content and explain your choices.
•    Document your digital creative process (screenshots to   include   in your development   book)
• Write a brief explanation about your concept. What is the   concept   and why   is   it   good?
